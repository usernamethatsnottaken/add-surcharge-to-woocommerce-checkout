# Add Surcharge to Woocommerce Checkout

This function will allow you to add a surcharge to Woocommerce checkout.
You can either apply this globally, so it works regardless of the payment method, OR you can apply it to a specific payment method.
I built this function when I was adding a surcharge to a credit card payment gateway.
